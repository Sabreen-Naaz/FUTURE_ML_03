# Resume / Candidate Screening System (Machine Learning)

## Overview
This project is developed as part of the Future Interns Machine Learning Internship (Task 3).
The objective is to build a system that automatically analyzes resumes and ranks candidates
based on how well they match a given job description.

## Problem Statement
Recruiters receive many resumes for each job opening, making manual screening difficult
and time-consuming. This project uses Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing
(NLP) techniques to compare resumes with a job description and automatically rank candidates.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- TF-IDF Vectorizer
- Cosine Similarity

## Project Workflow
1. Created a dataset containing candidate names and resume text
2. Defined a job description
3. Converted text into numerical vectors using TF-IDF
4. Calculated similarity scores using cosine similarity
5. Ranked candidates based on similarity score

## Output
- Each candidate receives a matching score based on the job description
- Candidates are ranked from highest to lowest suitability
- Helps recruiters shortlist the best candidates quickly

## Files in Repository
- resume_screening.ipynb – Implementation notebook
- README.md – Project documentation

## Internship Information
- Internship Track: Machine Learning
- Organization: Future Interns
- Task: Resume / Candidate Screening System (Task 3)

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how Machine Learning can automate the resume screening process
and help organizations identify suitable candidates efficiently.
