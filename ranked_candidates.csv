Question Answering System: As the sole resource on this project created a windows application with Phyton for COVID-19 related questions using BERT and ELMO language models.  The Frameworks were Pandas, Tensorflow, NLTK.  Data Visualization Tool: The objective of this project was to analyze communication structures, employee relationships and suspicious transactions by designing and implementing a data visualization tool.  The dataset included the VAST Challenge 2019 dataset with over 100,000+ data.  The Frameworks were Flask, Pandas and the Language was Phyton.  My responsibilities were data cleansing and data categorization.  From the data visualization Leadership was able to get insight in the growth, sales, costs and make decisions towards better performance.  Pre-Assess Melanoma: The objective of the project was to create a system that could pre-assess malignant melanoma using Matlab Language and image processing algorithms.  The system was trained with the images of malignant and healthy images.  My responsibilities included all development, testing and training.  The User Interface was the responsibility of other team member.  This system enabled the users to seek healthcare at earlier stages of melanoma.

Used Python - ""Random Forest Classifier"" to predict malignant tumors in breast tissue.  Here, main idea is building multiple models with different sample and different initial variables from train data set.  Goal is to determine what attributes provide the most information that can be used to predict malignancy.  My model was tested against “test data set” for accuracy and it is 96% successful in predicting whether the tumor is malignant or benign.   Data Mining- Image Classification:   It is the process to categorize images into one of several categories. Classification requires training for each image category.  Constructed Training and Test data for given image data using Java programming.  Constructed the five different classifier models using each training data file.  Tested these classifiers using test data and compared the prediction accuracies among five different classifiers. Achieved 95% accuracy.

This product has capability to show look-through exposure to complex instruments(e.g. pools,funds,ETF) and exotic derivative products(e.g. total return swap,index future). A game changing product being used very broadly at Wellington by our investors and clients since 2007.  Designed and developed a data quality reconciliation process to detect,respond and prevent data quality issues in a production environment for a mission critical product.  Delivered many quality products to production well in time and under budget with very limited number of resources and proactively took ownership to resolve complex problems faced by the team. As a result, I have achieved highest ratings ever possible by my manager for more than 10 years in a row.  Built a very strong and resilient team(from 4 team members to over 50) to support huge demand for the products developed by my team. I was responsible to develop,deliver and support multiple mission critical applications in production and I positioned my team well to innovate new quality products as well as support existing products in production.  Led a team to design and develop a product to provide investment performance returns across all financial instruments using innovative in-memory design. This product also provided a unique capability to provide look-through performance for the complex financial instruments at Wellington. The new product improved system performance by huge margin over legacy product and running successfully in production since 2013.  Led a team to successfully build and deliver a transaction processing system(known as unified transaction system) to represent transactions in a unified format to provide rolled up positions,exposure and performance data to meet emerging business requirements.  Due to continued success and huge demand of products built by my team, my team was asked to build a next generation IBOR platform. IBOR is a single source of truth for all investment holdings information, providing consistent, timely, and accurate position and exposure information that helps the front office make investment decisions. The IBOR provides both current and historical operational investment data and is used by many financial firms both in middle office and front office. IBOR is a perfect use case which combines both operational and analytical workloads (aka hybrid transaction/analytical processing (HTAP)). IBOR 2.0 is in production since Sep,2019 in AWS cloud environment using GridGain Ignite in-memory computing platform.  My team is now working on to build IBOR+ using proprietary technology and database using HTAP architecture. As a principal architect on IBOR+, I designed data model, instrument and transaction meta-models and other key foundational components to build a highly available,reliable and optimized IBOR architecture. IBOR+ is a transaction based system to provide real-time positions,exposures and investment performance data using one unified platform. IBOR+ provides both current and historical(as-of,as-at) data in lighting speed due to very innovative and cutting edge technology. IBOR+ is a foundational data platform to enable tier1 applications to migrate from monolithic architecture to service based architecture.  Designed,developed,implemented and supporting operational historical data store (ODS) application(>60TB) using Oracle Exadata. The ODS maintains historical positions,exposure and performance data. My team also migrated data and built a data pipeline from Oracle to Amazon Redshift to provide faster performance for OLAP and time series analysis.  Designed, developed,implemented fixed income portfolio management tool(FIPMT 4.0) to enable investors to make best investment decisions to return positive alpha for our clients. As a lead database developer, I contributed to solve database slowness problems by tuning complex database queries and improve data modeling to improve overall system performance of the system.  Designed and developed meta-data using yaml to represent complex business rules and application logic. Developed an automated process to update meta-data in yaml format using Python to improve efficiency and time to market.

This product has capability to show look-through exposure to complex instruments(e.g. pools,funds,ETF) and exotic derivative products(e.g. total return swap,index future). A game changing product being used very broadly at Wellington by our investors and clients since 2007.</li> <li> Designed and developed a data quality reconciliation process to detect,respond and prevent data quality issues in a production environment for a mission critical product.</li> <li> Delivered many quality products to production well in time and under budget with very limited number of resources and proactively took ownership to resolve complex problems faced by the team. As a result, I have achieved highest ratings ever possible by my manager for more than 10 years in a row.</li> <li> Built a very strong and resilient team(from 4 team members to over 50) to support huge demand for the products developed by my team. I was responsible to develop,deliver and support multiple mission critical applications in production and I positioned my team well to innovate new quality products as well as support existing products in production.</li> <li> Led a team to design and develop a product to provide investment performance returns across all financial instruments using innovative in-memory design. This product also provided a unique capability to provide look-through performance for the complex financial instruments at Wellington. The new product improved system performance by huge margin over legacy product and running successfully in production since 2013.</li> <li> Led a team to successfully build and deliver a transaction processing system(known as unified transaction system) to represent transactions in a unified format to provide rolled up positions,exposure and performance data to meet emerging business requirements.</li> <li> Due to continued success and huge demand of products built by my team, my team was asked to build a next generation IBOR platform. IBOR is a single source of truth for all investment holdings information, providing consistent, timely, and accurate position and exposure information that helps the front office make investment decisions. The IBOR provides both current and historical operational investment data and is used by many financial firms both in middle office and front office. IBOR is a perfect use case which combines both operational and analytical workloads (aka hybrid transaction/analytical processing (HTAP)). IBOR 2.0 is in production since Sep,2019 in AWS cloud environment using GridGain Ignite in-memory computing platform.</li> <li> My team is now working on to build IBOR+ using proprietary technology and database using HTAP architecture. As a principal architect on IBOR+, I designed data model, instrument and transaction meta-models and other key foundational components to build a highly available,reliable and optimized IBOR architecture. IBOR+ is a transaction based system to provide real-time positions,exposures and investment performance data using one unified platform. IBOR+ provides both current and historical(as-of,as-at) data in lighting speed due to very innovative and cutting edge technology. IBOR+ is a foundational data platform to enable tier1 applications to migrate from monolithic architecture to service based architecture.</li> <li> Designed,developed,implemented and supporting operational historical data store (ODS) application(&gt;60TB) using Oracle Exadata. The ODS maintains historical positions,exposure and performance data. My team also migrated data and built a data pipeline from Oracle to Amazon Redshift to provide faster performance for OLAP and time series analysis.</li> <li> Designed, developed,implemented fixed income portfolio management tool(FIPMT 4.0) to enable investors to make best investment decisions to return positive alpha for our clients. As a lead database developer, I contributed to solve database slowness problems by tuning complex database queries and improve data modeling to improve overall system performance of the system.</li> <li> Designed and developed meta-data using yaml to represent complex business rules and application logic. Developed an automated process to update meta-data in yaml format using Python to improve efficiency and time to market. Integrate metadata with Collibra to show data lineage, data dependency and other related information across multiple applications</li> </ul> </span> </span> </div> </div> <div class=""paragraph"" id=""PARAGRAPH_7ca99354-d8a1-48a1-a94f-d9dc8dae13cd_2_21921e0c-eb82-a208-0685-035d0fd30956"" itemscope="""" itemtype=""https://schema.org/Organization"" style=""padding-top:0px;""> <span class=""dates_wrapper""> <span class=""jobdates"" format=""%m/%Y"" id=""7ca99354-d8a1-48a1-a94f-d9dc8dae13cdJSTD2""> 12/2001</span> <span dependency=""JSTD+EDDT"">  to </span> <span class=""jobdates"" format=""%m/%Y"" id=""7ca99354-d8a1-48a1-a94f-d9dc8dae13cdEDDT2""> 01/2003</span> </span> <div class=""singlecolumn""> <span class=""paddedline""> <span class=""jobtitle"" id=""7ca99354-d8a1-48a1-a94f-d9dc8dae13cdJTIT2""> Senior Software Engineer</span> </span> <span class=""paddedline"" itemscope="""" itemtype=""https://schema.org/postalAddress""> <span class=""companyname"" id=""7ca99354-d8a1-48a1-a94f-d9dc8dae13cdCOMP2"" itemprop=""name""> Company Name</span> <span> <span>  － </span> </span> <span class=""joblocation jobcity"" id=""7ca99354-d8a1-48a1-a94f-d9dc8dae13cdJCIT2"" itemprop=""addressLocality""> City</span> <span> , </span> <span class=""joblocation jobstate"" id=""7ca99354-d8a1-48a1-a94f-d9dc8dae13cdJSTA2"" itemprop=""addressRegion""> State</span> <span class=""joblocation jobcountry"" id=""7ca99354-d8a1-48a1-a94f-d9dc8dae13cdJCNT2""> </span> </span> <span class=""paddedline""> <span class=""jobline"" id=""7ca99354-d8a1-48a1-a94f-d9dc8dae13cdJDES2"" itemprop=""description""> <p> As a senior developer, successfully developed and deployed a Commodity Trading System in production.
